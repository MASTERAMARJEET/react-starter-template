## Quick Clone

## Vite

[Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) is a fast frontend build tool. According to the [README](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/README.md), it consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that serves your source files over native ES modules, with rich built-in features and astonishingly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

## React

[React](https://github.com/facebook/react) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) is a superset of JavaScript. It is just one of NPM library, but it provides an original compiler.

When you use TypeScript with React, you can write JSX with TypeScript, called TSX. Then you can develop views written by  **Type-Safe** template.

## ESLint and Prettier

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is use to find and fix problems in your JavaScript code. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is a code formatter.

NOTICE: ESLint is setup to enforce [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
